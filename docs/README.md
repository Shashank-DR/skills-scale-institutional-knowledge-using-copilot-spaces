# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This docs/ folder contains OctoAcme's project management processes, templates, and runbooks. This README is a single entry point that explains how OctoAcme runs projects, highlights key workflows and roles, and links to the full process documents to make onboarding and discovery easy.

OctoAcme runs projects through a clear, stage-based lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective & Continuous Improvement. Initiation captures the problem statement, SMART objectives, stakeholders, and a Project One‑pager. Planning turns approved initiatives into a prioritized, estimated backlog, defines the Definition of Done, maps milestones and dependencies, and produces a release plan to align teams and stakeholders.

Day‑to‑day delivery follows a lightweight, disciplined rhythm: standups to surface progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs for status and risks, and demos/reviews at the end of each sprint or milestone. Work flows through a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a Pull Request process that encourages small, testable PRs with linked acceptance criteria, CI checks, and required approvals. Reporting relies on velocity, burndown, and dashboards anchored to the Project One‑pager success metrics.

Roles and ownership are explicit: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Developers implement features and tests; QA validates quality and acceptance criteria; and stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Quality assurance is integrated into the process: unit and integration tests, end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, CI security scans, checklist-driven releases with rollback plans, and a post‑deploy verification step. Retrospectives convert learnings into prioritized action items tracked in the backlog to enable continuous improvement.
